I spend most of my time thinking about the incentives that enable or hinder the adoption of Free & Open Source Software in India. Thanks to my day job, I get to talk to interesting folks from the industry, academia, and the civil society about FOSS and technology in general. If you’re trying to understand the Indian FOSS ecosystem, or if you’re trying to adopt or create FOSS in India, I’m happy to chat.\nFOSS communities have existed in India for many years, and FOSS United is one of the newer communities. Established in 2020, the FOSS United Foundation aims to promote and support the FOSS ecosystem in India. If you’re interested in participating in the FOSS United Community, please checkout out our discourse forum, participate in our telegram group, or drop by one of our events.\nI currently (Oct, 2025) live in Hyderabad, Telangana, India and I participate in a few communities - FOSS United Hyderabad, FOSS x Policy reading group, and SciPy India."
