I spend most of my time thinking about the incentives that enable or hinder the adoption of Free & Open Source Software in India. Thanks to my day job, I get to talk to interesting folks from the industry, academia, and the civil society about FOSS and technology in general. If you’re trying to understand the Indian FOSS ecosystem, or if you’re trying to adopt or create FOSS in India, I’m happy to chat.\nFOSS communities have existed in India for many years, and FOSS United is one of the newer communities. Established in 2020, the FOSS United Foundation aims to promote and support the FOSS ecosystem in India. If you’re interested in participating in the FOSS United Community, please checkout out our discourse forum, participate in our telegram group, or drop by one of our events."

After graduation, he lucked into a Scientific Software Developer role at Enthought, where he built software to solve Scientific and Engineering problems. While at Enthought, he got to work from Pune, India, Chennai, India, Austin, Texas, USA, and Cambridge, UK over eight interesting years. He started contributing to FOSS projects in the Scientific Python ecosystem while at Enthought, eventually becoming a maintainer for a few FOSS projects created at Enthought.\nHe got lucky again when he received a Scholarship from the FOSS United Foundation to pursue the Graduate Certificate in Public Policy (Tech & Policy) course by the Takshashila Institution. He started volunteering with the FOSS United Foundation afterwards, speaking at various FOSS United events, helping organize IndiaFOSS 2023, and organizing HydFOSS 2023. He eventually joined FOSS United full-time in May 2024 and has been with the Foundation ever since.\nHe loves to teach and has given talks and workshops on various topics like Python Programming, FOSS, FOSS Policy, and Tech Policy in general.\nHis wife, Dr. Preeti Saryan, co-founded the Saryan Vigyan Foundation.
