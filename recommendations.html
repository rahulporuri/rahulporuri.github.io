                    <p>
                        It has been a privilege to work alongside Rahul Poruri 8 years at Enthought, where he
                        consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a dedication to success. Rahul's understanding
                        of Enthought's stack and his ability to apply it in practical contexts have been valuable to our
                        team's efforts.</p>

                    <p>His technical skills, coupled with a collaborative spirit, have made him a go-to person for both
                        colleagues and clients.</p>

                    <p>Beyond his professional skills, Rahul's positive approach and willingness to support others have
                        contributed significantly to our team dynamics. He consistently shows a genuine commitment to
                        our collective goals and is always ready to lend a hand where needed.</p>

                    <p>I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with Rahul and recommend him as a dedicated and
                        knowledgeable professional.</p>

                    <p>
                    <p>I have had the pleasure to know Rahul for many years and to work closely with him over the past
                        two years as his direct line manager on one of our scientific consulting projects. On this
                        project, Rahul was part of a team responsible for the operationalization of a machine learning
                        pipeline for automated animal behavior classification and the construction of a GUI application
                        to make this pipeline accessible to client users. In addition to assisting with development and
                        design of this system, Rahul provided valuable assistance and mentorship to newer team members
                        and consistently worked to identify novel approaches to improve project operations.</p>

                    <p>Rahul has demonstrated a tenacious quest for continued experience and growth. These efforts at
                        times involved intentionally taking on tasks that would provide exposure to new technical areas,
                        but also extended to extracurricular activities such as technical book clubs and forums. Rahul
                        also made a point of sharing knowledge he had gained with others at the company through posts
                        and presentations. Last year, Rahul also helped organize a large technical conference in his
                        extracurricular time, exemplifying his drive for continued growth both for himself and the
                        community.</p>

                    <p>I highly recommend Rahul for all future employers looking for a technically skilled,
                        experienced, and well-rounded developer with a determination to improve both a given project and
                        the team around it.</p>

                    <p>
                        Rahul was not only a diligent, competent developer but also a caring, dependable project
                        manager. We worked
                        together for about a year in a project that supported other development teams. There were many
                        channels
                        through which requests may be coming the team's way but he'd make sure they didn't fall through
                        the crack.
                        He
                        took ownership of the product we were building and was always on the look out for possibility to
                        improve the
                        product as well as our development process. He was hands-on when it was needed and always did
                        his best to
                        facilitate the team despite challenging time zone differences. He was sensitive about the
                        different
                        technical
                        expertise present among the team members as well and would entrust developers to do what they
                        are good at
                        doing, and more, for their professional development. Rahul would be a great asset to any company
                        and a great
                        colleague to anyone.

                    <p>
                        It is rare to come across an extremely talented and well-rounded person like Rahul. I had the
                        pleasure of
                        working with him for over an year at Enthought, and during that time I grew to appreciate and
                        rely on his
                        abilities as a engineering leader. His managerial aptitude is complimented by his deep technical
                        expertise.
                        This, I believe, allows him to set manageable targets, so you are never overworked or
                        under-worked. Rahul
                        significantly contributed to a number of projects concurrently, and he actively took initiative
                        and
                        ownership
                        of outstanding issues in those projects. He played the role of my mentor, and as such he pushed
                        me to become
                        a
                        better software developer by directing me to increasingly challenging problems. He was always
                        kind and
                        willing
                        to share his knowledge. He also frequently reached out to check on my well-being, and learn
                        about my
                        interests
                        and career goals. Every meeting or conversation with Rahul is fun-filled and peppered with some
                        of his
                        quirky
                        astronomy humor -- which, by the way, is out of this world! I would gladly work with Rahul again
                        and would
                        not
                        hesitate to recommend him.

                        It was a pleasure working with Rahul at Enthought. He took the responsibility to own many
                        products he has
                        worked on and insisted on the highest standards when maintaining the codebase. He dived deep
                        into technical
                        details and were happy to share his knowledge with the colleagues. I benefited a lot from
                        discussions with
                        Rahul and trusted him as a reliable developer at work.

                    <p>
                        I worked under Rahul as a scientific software developer at Enthought for about a year. He was
                        not only a
                        great
                        manager, but an outstanding mentor for me. As a boss he assigned a fair workload that was a
                        healthy mix of
                        being manageable yet challenging. He was always very understanding, and in my time working for
                        him I never
                        felt over-stressed or pressured. He helped me work through and learn from challenging problems,
                        and taught
                        me
                        so much about being a better developer. He was both extremely intelligent and very diligent. I
                        was always
                        impressed at both the quantity and the quality of his development work knowing that he had many
                        management
                        related responsibilities to attend to as well. We worked out of two very different time zones
                        and he would
                        consistently work late into the night to do code review, etc. to ensure I wasn’t blocked. He
                        actively
                        reached
                        out to me about my career goals / interests independent of our project and I genuinely believe
                        he wants me
                        to
                        be successful. All in all he was a joy to work for, and I have the utmost respect for him.
