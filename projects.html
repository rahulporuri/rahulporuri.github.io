        <p>With <a target="_blank" href="http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram">Dr. L. Sriramkumar</a>*,
          I developed a python code to numerically estimate the evolution of tensor perturbations
          during inflation and to estimate the power spectrum of tensor power spectrum at
          super-Hubble scales. We studied the power spectrum of tensor perturbations during two
          models of inflation, namely power law inflation and inflation driven by small field
          potential model. Given two different forms of the potential driving inflation, we solved
          the background equations to solve for the evolution of the scalar field driving inflation.
          Using this solution, we estimate the value of tensor perturbations. A detailed report that
          discusses the numerical methods can be found <a href="minor_thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>With <a target="_blank" href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jmould/">Prof. Jeremy Mould</a>*, I reduced
          and analyzed integral field spectra of galaxies observed by the <a target="_blank"
            href="http://sami-survey.org">SAMI</a>
          instrument on the AAT. We combed through the spectrum looking for H alpha emission lines and
          `extracted their corresponding line widths. Instead of using the HI line widths, as is conventionally
          done, we used the H alpha line widths to construct the TF reln. We used the SDSS r, i & z magnitudes
          and galactic inclinations from NED/IPAC.</p>

        <p>During our work, we discovered double-horned H alpha emission peaks. This double horned profile
          is usually observed in the HI galactic emission line profile, in galaxies with large rotation velocities.</p>

        <p>The process of line finding and extraction was initially done one galaxy-at-a-time but it has now been
          automated using a python script. Further analysis & visualization was also done using python.</p>

        <p> As part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl/pos">POS</a>* program, I observed
          the pulsar
          PSR B1749-28 using the ORT at the frequency 326.5 MHz with a bandwidth of 16 Mhz. I reduced the data
          using the SIGPROC package and studied the period, strength and the dispersion measure of the pulsar.
          They were measured to within an error of 5%. My presentation at the end of the school can be found
          <a target="_blank" href="research/r_pos.html">here</a>
        </p>

        <p> Going beyond the usual measurements, I studied the frequency response of the telescope to the
          calibrator. Ideally, this is a homogenous function and any deviation from homogenity should be
          accounted for while data reduction. This inhomogenity can creep into the measurement of strength
          the pulsar and lead to errors. Upon enquiry, I was informed that this problem was infact being
          corrected in the current update cycle.</p>

        <p>I also attended talks on pulsar science during the observation cycle.</p>

        <p>Under the guidance of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.iist.ac.in/scientists/anand-narayanan/profile.html">
            Prof. Anand Narayanan</a>*, I studied Quasars and their spectral properties. I constructed
          color-color and color-redshift plots for 146,659 quasars from the SDSS DR9. The color-redshift
          relation follows roughly the same trend as that from Richards et al. (2001) on the "Colors of
          Quasars from the 2625 SDSS", albiet larger variance thanks to the bigger data set. A mean
          color-redshift relation was inferred and a simulated color-redshift relation was constructed
          using the composite quasar spectrum from Vandenberk et al. (2001).</p>

        <p> Vertical features can be noticed in the color-redshift plots which upon further enquiry
          turned out to be M type stars. This was spectrally confirmed. Such false positives are known
          to creep through the automated pipeline and for a pure quasar sample, one should use Paris et al. (2014).</p>

        <p>I queried the SDSS DR9 for quasar data using SQLquery and data analysis & visualisation was done using
          python.</p>

        <p>During the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atsoa.aries.res.in/">ATSOA</a>*, as part of a team of 4, I
          reduced
          and analyzed polarimetric data of the star forming region Stock 8 in the constellation Auriga. The
          observations were made using the ARIES Imaging Polarimeter (AImPol) instrument on the Sampurnanand
          telescope, ARIES.</p>

        <p>We inferred the average size of the dust grains in the region and the orientation of the magnetic field.</p>
