                <p>With <a href="http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram">Dr. L. Sriramkumar</a>*, 
                I developed a python code to numerically estimate the evolution of tensor perturbations 
                during inflation and to estimate the power spectrum of tensor power spectrum at 
                super-Hubble scales. We studied the power spectrum of tensor perturbations during two 
                models of inflation, namely power law inflation and inflation driven by small field 
                potential model. Given two different forms of the potential driving inflation, we solved 
                the background equations to solve for the evolution of the scalar field driving inflation. 
                Using this solution, we estimate the value of tensor perturbations. A detailed report that 
                discusses the numerical methods can be found <a href="minor_thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                <p>With <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jmould/">Prof. Jeremy Mould</a>*, I reduced 
                and analyzed integral field spectra of galaxies observed by the <a href="http://sami-survey.org">SAMI</a> 
                instrument on the AAT.  We combed through the spectrum looking for H alpha emission lines and 
                `extracted their corresponding line widths. Instead of using the HI line widths, as is conventionally 
                done, we used the H alpha line widths to construct the TF reln. We used the SDSS r, i & z magnitudes 
                and galactic inclinations from NED/IPAC.</p>

                <p>During our work, we discovered double-horned H alpha emission peaks. This double horned profile 
                is usually observed in the HI galactic emission line profile, in galaxies with large rotation velocities.</p>

                <p> As part of the <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl/pos">POS</a>* program, I observed the pulsar 
                PSR B1749-28 using the ORT at the frequency 326.5 MHz with a bandwidth of 16 Mhz. I reduced the data 
                using the SIGPROC package and studied the period, strength and the dispersion measure of the pulsar. 
                They were measured to within an error of 5%. My presentation at the end of the school can be found 
                <a href="research/r_pos.html">here</a></p>

                <p> Going beyond the usual measurements, I studied the frequency response of the telescope to the 
                calibrator. Ideally, this is a homogenous function and any deviation from homogenity should be 
                accounted for while data reduction. This inhomogenity can creep into the measurement of strength 
                the pulsar and lead to errors. Upon enquiry, I was informed that this problem was infact being 
                corrected in the current update cycle.</p>

                <p>I also attended talks on pulsar science during the observation cycle.</p>

                <p>Under the guidance of <a href="http://www.iist.ac.in/scientists/anand-narayanan/profile.html">
                    Prof. Anand Narayanan</a>*, I studied Quasars and their spectral properties. I constructed 
                color-color and color-redshift plots for 146,659 quasars from the SDSS DR9. The color-redshift 
                relation follows roughly the same trend as that from Richards et al. (2001) on the "Colors of 
                Quasars from the 2625 SDSS", albiet larger variance thanks to the bigger data set. A mean 
                color-redshift relation was inferred and a simulated color-redshift relation was constructed 
                using the composite quasar spectrum from Vandenberk et al. (2001).</p>

                <p> Vertical features can be noticed in the color-redshift plots which upon further enquiry 
                turned out to be M type stars. This was spectrally confirmed. Such false positives are known 
                to creep through the automated pipeline and for a pure quasar sample, one should use Paris et al. (2014).</p>

                <p>I queried the SDSS DR9 for quasar data using SQLquery and data analysis & visualisation was done using 
                python.</p>

                and analyzed polarimetric data of the star forming region Stock 8 in the constellation Auriga. The
