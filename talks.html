            <p><b>Cython</b>:</p>
            <p>If you didn't know, Cython is used to speedup Python code. Cython is actually
            two things - Cython is a language, which is a superset of the Python language and
            Cython is a library that can understand and compile Cython code.</p>
            <p>In this brief talk, I briefly talked about why Python is slow and what other
            alternatives were available for someone interested in speeding up their Python
            code. Then, I cythonized a simple function and demonstrated Cython syntax. I then
            demonstrated how Cython code can be compiled and used.</p>
            <p>The content was first presented at a 20 min talk at a

            <p><b>Advanced concepts in Python</b>:</p>
            <p>Starting with reading from and writing to files, I introduced
            advanced concepts in Python and how to take advantage of core concepts
            in Python, instead of simply rewriting C code with different syntax.
            The slides cover a few types in python, context managers, iterators,
            functions, classes & methods and generators in Python.</p>
            <p>The content was first presented at a ~5 hour long workshop held
            at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai.</p>

            <p><b>Automated Testing in Python</b>:</p>
            <p>I introduced the unittest and mock modules and gave examples
            of how tests can be written using the TestCase class from the
            unittest module. I also introduced how the mock module can be
            used to mock entire objects or attributes/methods defined on an
            object.</p>

            <a href="http://scipy.in/2016#schedule">SciPy India 2016</a>, 
            which was held at IIT Bombay, Mumbai. I also presented
            the same content at a 
            <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/235899602/">local meetup</a>.</p>

            <p><b>An introduction to Git and GitHub</b>:</p>
            <p>I introduced Git and GitHub to the audience using two workflows,
            a basic workflow which talks about commits and pushing and an advanced
            workflow that introduces the concept of branches in Git and PRs/
            merging branches in Git/GitHub.</p>
