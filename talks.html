            <p><b>Let's skim the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2023</b></p>
            <p>The last date for comments on the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022
              is behind us but that shouldn't prevent us from understanding and discussing the
              bill, its contents and its impact.</p>
            <p>In this interactive talk, I will pick a few key points from the draft bill to
              discuss with the audience. I recently delivered an informal version of this talk
              at the FOSS United Banglore meetup. The proposed talk will be a bit more formal,
              focusing on the key aspects of the bill instead of trying to read/skim the entire
              bill from the top to the bottom.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I will focus on the definition of "Personal Data" as covered by the
              bill, what a "Data Fiduciary" is, the rights and responsibilities of a
              "Data Principal", the "Data Protection Board", ending with proposed limits on
              penalties that can be imposed by the "Board" for non-compliance.</p>
            <p>Examples of audience interaction in the talk are</p>
              <ul>
                <li>personal identifiable data e.g. PAN Card, Address</li>
                <li>examples of what isn't personal identifiable data e.g. food preferences</li>
                <li>Notices and Consent in relation to the personal data</li>
                <li>Significant Data Fiduciary</li>
                <li>whether or not the proposed fines are sufficient</li>
              </ul>
            <p>This talk is not a policy analysis. I will point to reports put out by
              organizations like the FOSS United, IFF, eGov Foundation instead.</p>
            <p>Slides are available on
              <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/talks/blob/ef75854905ec46eb78ddde8876b0712e2b5643a9/annotated_dpdpb.pdf">GitHub</a>.

            <p><b>Scientific Computing 101 with Python</b>:</p>
            <p>With the recent interest in Data Science, a good understanding of the scientific
            libraries central to pursuing Data Science using Python is essential, libraries like
            Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. These libraries are central to Scientific Computing and
            Data Science with Python and this workshop meant to provide a solid foundation.</p>
            <p>The workshop was completely delivered using Jupyter Notebooks. The relevant material
            can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/talks/tree/master/scientific_computing_101">talks GitHub repository</a>.
            The notebooks introduce the libraries and the features they provide us. I have also
            added exercises and references in the notebooks.</p>
            <p>As always, comments and suggestions are welcome and highly appreciated. If you have
            any, make an issue on the same GitHub repository or mail me.</p>

            <p><b>Virtual environments and Standalone environments in Python</b>:</p>
            <p>Virtual environments and Standalone environments in Python are two ways to
            keep your system Python installation clean and work on multiple projects without
            worrying about dependency problems.</p>
            <p>This was a brief 20 min talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PythonPune/events/239079298/">April meet of the PythonPune meetup group</a>.

            <p><b>Cython</b>:</p>
            <p>If you didn't know, Cython is used to speedup Python code. Cython is actually
            two things - Cython is a language, which is a superset of the Python language and
            Cython is a library that can understand and compile Cython code.</p>
            <p>In this brief talk, I briefly talked about why Python is slow and what other
            alternatives were available for someone interested in speeding up their Python
            code. Then, I cythonized a simple function and demonstrated Cython syntax. I then
            demonstrated how Cython code can be compiled and used.</p>
            <p>The content was first presented at a 20 min talk at a

            <p><b>Advanced concepts in Python</b>:</p>
            <p>Starting with reading from and writing to files, I introduced
            advanced concepts in Python and how to take advantage of core concepts
            in Python, instead of simply rewriting C code with different syntax.
            The slides cover a few types in python, context managers, iterators,
            functions, classes & methods and generators in Python.</p>
            <p>The content was first presented at a ~5 hour long workshop held

            <p><b>Automated Testing in Python</b>:</p>
            <p>I introduced the unittest and mock modules and gave examples
            of how tests can be written using the TestCase class from the
            unittest module. I also introduced how the mock module can be
            used to mock entire objects or attributes/methods defined on an
            object.</p>

            which was held at IIT Bombay, Mumbai. I also presented
            the same content at a

            <p><b>An introduction to Git and GitHub</b>:</p>
            <p>I introduced Git and GitHub to the audience using two workflows,
            a basic workflow which talks about commits and pushing and an advanced
            workflow that introduces the concept of branches in Git and PRs/
            merging branches in Git/GitHub.</p>
            <p>The content was first presented at a ~2 hour long workshop at
            <a href="http://scipy.in/2016#schedule">SciPy India 2016</a>,
