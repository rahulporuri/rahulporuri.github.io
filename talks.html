        <p><b>An invited talk and a panel discussion on "Opensource and Innovation Ecosystem"</b>:</p>
        <p>I loved speaking and being part of the "Opensource and Innovation Ecosystem" panel at
          the Cloud India Conclave. It was a great privilege sharing the stage with stalwarts of
          Indian Academia and Industry.</p>
        <p>Based on my experience at Enthought , I had three key points to the audience at the Conclave.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teach computing to domain experts. Solving the problems that domain experts have
            using computer science is only the first step. Teaching domain experts to write
            scripts isn't enough. Only when you enable domain experts to build and maintain
            large-scale software can you really enable #digitaltransformation within their
            respective companies.</li>
          <li>Acknowledge the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that you use, both in Academia
            and in the Industry. While a few popular FOSS projects are well recognized and funded,
            a large chunk of projects don't get the recognition they deserve, let alone funding to
            sustain the projects in the long term. The first step towards contributing to such
            open source communities is acknowledging their use publicly. Kailash Nadh and the
            folks at @Zerodha are great at this because they not only acknowledge usage, they go
            into how they are used and how much money they save thanks to FOSS. After
            acknowledgement, you can start considering potentially contributing code to the
            project directly and/or contributing financially to the project.</li>
          <li>Most of the time, when people talk about #opensource , they are referring to open
            source code but that's not always the case. Dr. Vijay Chandru of Strand Genomics
            mentioned how open biological datasets could revolutionize the biotech ecosystem.
            A fundamental failing of most western #ai and #ml models is their inability to handle
            diverse data. We need to recognize that Diversity is a key strength for India and we
            need to tap into this by creating diverse open source datasets (with the relevant
            legal protections for privacy) which will enable the creation and sustenance of an
            innovative ecosystem.</li>
          <p>I cannot thank the organizers of the Cloud India Conclave enough for inviting me and
            letting me share my perspective on #opensource.</p>

        <p><b>A Lightning talk on the Digital India Act 2023</b>:</p>
        <p>I gave a short lightning talk on the upcoming Digital India Act 2023 at the March 2023
          monthly meetup of BengaluruFOSS. I simply used the slides from

        <p><b>Let's skim the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2023</b></p>
        <p>The last date for comments on the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022
          is behind us but that shouldn't prevent us from understanding and discussing the
          bill, its contents and its impact.</p>
        <p>In this interactive talk, I focused on the definition of "Personal Data" as covered
          by the bill, what a "Data Fiduciary" is, the rights and responsibilities of a
          "Data Principal", the "Data Protection Board", ending with proposed limits on
          penalties that can be imposed by the "Board" for non-compliance.</p>
        <p>This talk is not a policy analysis. I pointed to reports put out by
          organizations like the FOSS United, IFF, eGov Foundation instead.</p>

        <p>Praise for the talk:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>"The next talk was by Mr. Poruri Sai Rahul, an energetic and talented guy. His
              talk was about Digital Personal Data Protection Bills (DPDPB). This was again a
              new topic for me. And this talk was the one I enjoyed the most. In short, the
              bill was about the protection of your data collected from whatever online
              platform you use. It may be a search engine or any other app. He started with a
              game called “Cost and Benefits”. What we had to do was just point out when the
              Cost and Benefits were high in a particular paragraph from the Data Bill. In my
              opinion, this was the only talk that was very interactive of all."

            <p>"I had the pleasure of attending an event at Indian Institute of Technology,
              Bombay hosted by FOSS United, where Sai Rahul Poruri delivered an insightful
              talk on the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022. Rahul discussed
              key aspects of the bill, including the definition of 'Personal Data', the role
              of a 'Data Fiduciary', the rights of a 'Data Principal', and proposed penalties
              for non-compliance. He also facilitated engaging discussions with the audience
              on topics such as personal identifiable data and notices and consent. It was a
              great opportunity to learn from a knowledgeable speaker and connect with
              like-minded individuals in the tech community."

        <p><b>Scientific Computing 101 with Python</b>:</p>
        <p>With the recent interest in Data Science, a good understanding of the scientific
          libraries central to pursuing Data Science using Python is essential, libraries like
          Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. These libraries are central to Scientific Computing and
          Data Science with Python and this workshop meant to provide a solid foundation.</p>
        <p>The workshop was completely delivered using Jupyter Notebooks. The relevant material
          can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/rahulporuri/talks/tree/master/scientific_computing_101">talks
            GitHub repository</a>.
          The notebooks introduce the libraries and the features they provide us. I have also
          added exercises and references in the notebooks.</p>
        <p>As always, comments and suggestions are welcome and highly appreciated. If you have
          any, make an issue on the same GitHub repository or mail me.</p>

        <p><b>Cython</b>:</p>
        <p>If you didn't know, Cython is used to speedup Python code. Cython is actually
          two things - Cython is a language, which is a superset of the Python language and
          Cython is a library that can understand and compile Cython code.</p>
        <p>In this brief talk, I briefly talked about why Python is slow and what other
          alternatives were available for someone interested in speeding up their Python
          code. Then, I cythonized a simple function and demonstrated Cython syntax. I then
          demonstrated how Cython code can be compiled and used.</p>

        <p><b>An introduction to Git and GitHub</b>:</p>
        <p>I introduced Git and GitHub to the audience using two workflows,
          a basic workflow which talks about commits and pushing and an advanced
          workflow that introduces the concept of branches in Git and PRs/
          merging branches in Git/GitHub.</p>
        <p>The content was first presented at a ~2 hour long workshop at
          <a href="http://scipy.in/2016#schedule">SciPy India 2016</a>,
          which was held at IIT Bombay, Mumbai.
