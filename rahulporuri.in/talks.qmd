# Talks

I strongly believe that if I can't explain a concept to a layperson, I haven't really understood
the concept. I've been engaged in public speaking since 2009, when I was part of
the Astronomy Club at my almamater. For more than 15 years, I've tried to explain concepts in
Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology, Physics, Python, Scientific Computing, Software development and
Software Architecture, Free & Open Source Software, Digital Commons, Public Policy/Tech Policy,
and more. What follows is a non-exhaustive list, in reverse chronological order.
