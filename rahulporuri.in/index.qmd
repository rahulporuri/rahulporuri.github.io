I'm a Physics student-turned software developer, currently cosplaying as the CEO of the
[FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org). I spend most of my time thinking
about the incentives that enable or hinder the adoption of Free & Open Source Software in India.
Thanks to my day job, I get to talk to interesting folks from the industry, academia, and the civil
society about FOSS and technology in general. If you're trying to understand the Indian FOSS
ecosystem, or if you're trying to adopt or create FOSS in India, I'm happy to chat.

FOSS communities have existed in India for many years, and FOSS United is one of the newer
communities. Established in 2020, the FOSS United Foundation aims to promote and support the FOSS
ecosystem in India. If you're interested in participating in the FOSS United Community, please
checkout out our [discourse forum](https://forum.fossunited.org), participate in our
[telegram group](https://t.me/fossunited), or drop by one of our
[events](https://fossunited.org/events/timeline).

I currently (Oct, 2025) live in Hyderabad, Telangana, India and I participate in a few communities
- [FOSS United Hyderabad](https://fossunited.org/c/hyderabad), [FOSS x Policy reading group](https://fossunited.org/c/fossxpolicy),
and [SciPy India](https://scipy-india.github.io/).
