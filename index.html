                <p> I am graduate student at the Dept. of Biological Sciences, 
                at IISER Bhopal. I am currently working with 
                <a href="https://www.iiserbhopal.ac.in/profile.php?empid=MjAx&page=Biological%2520Sciences&pid=42&id=43">Dr. Vinita Gowda</a>.
                I graduated with an integrated Masters degree from IISER Trivandrum
                with a Major in Biology and a Minor in Chemistry. I worked with 
                <a href="">Dr. I Forgot Her Name</a> for my Master's thesis project,
                which was on <em>something to do with bees</em>. I was lucky enough 
                to work on projects that gave me a lot of experience working in the
                field during my undergraduate years. For more on the work I've been 
                part of, refer to the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
                
                <p>I also like to occassionally ramble, which you can 
                read about on <a href="blog.html">my blog</a>.
                My twitter handle is <code>@preetisaryan</code> and you can email
                me at <code><a href="mailto:preetisaryan999@gmail.com">preetisaryan999@gmail.com</a></code></p>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> If you feel deja-vu as you are going through 
                this website, as though you've seen this layout before, 
                it's because I lifted the layout straight out of 
                <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a></p>
