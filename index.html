        <p> I am the Head of Software at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.softcircuits.in/">SoftCircuits Labs.</a>.
          Previously, I was a Senior Scientific Software Developer at

          I'm currently living and working in Hyderabad, India.
          Earlier, I worked for Enthought in Pune and Chennai in India and Cambridge in the UK.
          I also spent close to an year in Austin, Texas, USA. I graduated with a Dual Degree
          (B.S. & M.S.) in Physics from IIT Madras, Chennai, India.

        <p>A few projects that I worked in the past are mapping the

        <p> I also worked on a number of astronomy and physics related
          projects over my college life, projects that

            Rahul was not only a diligent, competent developer but also a caring, dependable project manager. We worked
            together for about a year in a project that supported other development teams. There were many channels
            through which requests may be coming the team's way but he'd make sure they didn't fall through the crack.
            He
            took ownership of the product we were building and was always on the look out for possibility to improve the
            product as well as our development process. He was hands-on when it was needed and always did his best to
            facilitate the team despite challenging time zone differences. He was sensitive about the different
            technical
            expertise present among the team members as well and would entrust developers to do what they are good at
            doing, and more, for their professional development. Rahul would be a great asset to any company and a great
            colleague to anyone.

          <p>
            It is rare to come across an extremely talented and well-rounded person like Rahul. I had the pleasure of
            working with him for over an year at Enthought, and during that time I grew to appreciate and rely on his
            abilities as a engineering leader. His managerial aptitude is complimented by his deep technical expertise.
            This, I believe, allows him to set manageable targets, so you are never overworked or under-worked. Rahul
            significantly contributed to a number of projects concurrently, and he actively took initiative and
            ownership
            of outstanding issues in those projects. He played the role of my mentor, and as such he pushed me to become
            a
            better software developer by directing me to increasingly challenging problems. He was always kind and
            willing
            to share his knowledge. He also frequently reached out to check on my well-being, and learn about my
            interests
            and career goals. Every meeting or conversation with Rahul is fun-filled and peppered with some of his
            quirky
            astronomy humor -- which, by the way, is out of this world! I would gladly work with Rahul again and would
            not
            hesitate to recommend him.

            It was a pleasure working with Rahul at Enthought. He took the responsibility to own many products he has
            worked on and insisted on the highest standards when maintaining the codebase. He dived deep into technical
            details and were happy to share his knowledge with the colleagues. I benefited a lot from discussions with
            Rahul and trusted him as a reliable developer at work.

          <p>
            I worked under Rahul as a scientific software developer at Enthought for about a year. He was not only a
            great
            manager, but an outstanding mentor for me. As a boss he assigned a fair workload that was a healthy mix of
            being manageable yet challenging. He was always very understanding, and in my time working for him I never
            felt over-stressed or pressured. He helped me work through and learn from challenging problems, and taught
            me
            so much about being a better developer. He was both extremely intelligent and very diligent. I was always
            impressed at both the quantity and the quality of his development work knowing that he had many management
            related responsibilities to attend to as well. We worked out of two very different time zones and he would
            consistently work late into the night to do code review, etc. to ensure I wasnâ€™t blocked. He actively
            reached
            out to me about my career goals / interests independent of our project and I genuinely believe he wants me
            to
            be successful. All in all he was a joy to work for, and I have the utmost respect for him.
